📘 README.md – DNA Methylation Hackathon: EPIC v1 vs v2 Platform Comparison
🧬 Project Title

Comparative Analysis of DNA Methylation Patterns Using EPIC v1 and v2 Arrays

🧠 Objective

To compare DNA methylation profiles generated by Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC v1 and v2 platforms and evaluate their consistency. A secondary goal was to identify specific probes (CpG sites) that best discriminate between the two platforms using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network classifier.

📂 Dataset

Source: NCBI GEO dataset GSE286313

Files Used:

GSE286313_MatrixProcessed_GPL21145.csv (EPIC v1)

GSE286313_MatrixProcessed_GPL33022.csv (EPIC v2)

Each file contains:

Rows = CpG probes

Columns = Samples

Values = Beta-values (methylation levels)

⚙️ Setup & Requirements

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

🧪 Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing

Loaded v1 and v2 matrices.

Intersected common CpG probes.

Selected 100 random probes (for memory efficiency).

Transposed data to shape [samples × probes].

Labeled platform: v1 → 0, v2 → 1.

2. Train/Test Split

70% Training, 30% Testing.

Standardized features using StandardScaler.

3. MLP Classifier

Built using sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier

Architecture: 1 hidden layer with 50 neurons.

Achieved ~100% test accuracy.

4. Probe Importance Extraction

Retrieved weights from the first layer.

Ranked probes by mean absolute weight across neurons.

Saved top 100 most informative CpG probes.

📈 Results
🔍 Classifier Performance

Accuracy: ~100% on test set.

Interpretability: Most influential probes identified.

📊 Visualizations

top_probes_mlp.png: Barplot of top 20 discriminative probes.

Heatmaps & boxplots (optional, can be added).

📁 Output Files

top_100_mlp_probes.csv: Ranked list of influential probes.

top_probes_mlp.png: Feature importance chart.

🔬 Interpretation

The high classification accuracy suggests that subtle but consistent differences exist between the two platforms.

Top-ranked probes may serve as candidates for platform-specific bias correction or as biomarkers for cross-platform validation.
